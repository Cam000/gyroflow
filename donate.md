I know a lot of people don't have a bunch of money to throw at fancy gear or internet strangers (which was part of the reason for starting the project in the first place), so if you want to help out, the most useful way is to try out the tool, share your results, and send new lens presets that others can use. However, if you are feeling generous, appreciate the development so far, and perhaps want to support future work and (hardware?) testing, here's a paypal button.

If you would like to follow the development even closer, and perhaps try some pre-release tools/plugins in the future, there's also a Patreon:
