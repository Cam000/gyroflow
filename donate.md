I know a lot of people don't have a bunch of money to throw at fancy gear or internet strangers (which was part of the reason for starting the project in the first place), so if you want to help out, the most useful way is to try out the tool, share your results, and send new lens presets that others can use. However, if you are feeling generous, appreciate the development so far, and perhaps want to support future work and (hardware?) testing, here's a donation button.

_idk, feels weird accepting money for something "unfinished" that I'm totally unqualified to work on, but eh, you decide_
